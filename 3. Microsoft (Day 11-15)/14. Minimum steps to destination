QUESTION:
----------

  Given an infinite number line. 
  You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. 
  The condition is that in the ith move, youmust take i steps. 
  Given a destination D , find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.

Example 1:

  Input: D = 2
  Output: 3
  Explaination: The steps takn are +1, -2 and +3.
  
  
Example 2:

  Input: D = 10
  Output: 4
  Explaination: The steps are +1, +2, +3 and +4.

SOLUTION:
----------

class Solution{
public:
    int minSteps(int D){
        // code here
        int steps=0;
        int sum=0;
        
        while(sum<D){
            sum+=steps;
            steps++;
        }
        
        while((sum-D)%2){
            sum+=steps;
            steps++;
        }
        
        return steps-1;
        
    }
};
